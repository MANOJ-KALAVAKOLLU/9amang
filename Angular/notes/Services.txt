Services: Servie is a class that encapsulate data and functionality that can be used throught the application
services are used to
          -- share the data
          -- provide encapsulation
          -- provide single source of truth

So, These are common files that contains data and functionality to share any component
     Advantages of services:
        i. Decoupling:services help components decople with each other so that each component can behave individually
        ii. Reusability : services can be re used in multiple other components

creating and using a service: 
       i. To create a service , we can use "ng generate service service-name"
       ii. it will create service-name.ts file and it contains a class for storing data and functionalities
       iii. The class is decorated with @Injector for sharing
       iv. we need to import service in module or component files to make it work


HttpClient:   HttpClient is a default service provided by Angular which is used for HttpRequests such as GET,POST,PUT,DELTE etc..,. it will interact with API's and returns Observable.
HttpClient provides basic methods such as
    get() -- makes the GET request to the specified URL
    post() -- makes the POST request and send body to the specified URL
    put() --makes the PUT request to the speified url with changes
    delete() -- makes the DELETE request to the specified URL
Difference between fetch and HttpClient:
    fetch -- normally JS used browser method fetch for HTTP HttpRequests
          -- it is a method that needs to be called and pass parameters
          -- it returns promises

   HttpClient -- Angular uses default Service "HttpClient"
              -- it is a service so need to be injected
              -- it returns observables

Difference between promises and observables
    promises -- used for handling Asynchronous JS (better than callbacks)
             -- A promise will have three states with default state 'pending' and others 'fulfilled' and 'rejected'
             -- A promise is handled by client using then and catch. If promise resolves it executed then else it executes catch

    Onservable -- used for handling Asynchronous code
               -- it is a series of promises
               -- observable can be solved by using subscribe method


How to use HttpClient :
        i. Import HttpClientProvider in app config file
        ii. import and inject httpclient in component file
        iii.  do any http reuest using get(),post(),put(),delete()
        iv. subscribe to the observable and display the result in template
