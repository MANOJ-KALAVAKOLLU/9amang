Data Binding : It refers to the communication between component file (.ts) and template file (.html) within a component
There are two kinds of Data Binding such as
    i. one way Data Binding
    ii. Two way Data Binding

i. one way Data Binding:
      using this we can send data from template to component (or) component to template files
    There are three possible ways for one way data binding:
    a. string Interpolation : it is used to get the data from component file to template file as a string . it is represented with double braces
      eg:    //html                                  //ts
      <p>The fruit is {{name}}<p>              public class componentName{
                                                  name:string = "apple"
                                                }
    But it always pass data as strings, sometimes we need to pass other data such as boolean. for that we can use property Binding
   
   b. property Binding: it is also used to get the data from component file to template file as it is. it is represented as square brackets
      <element   [property]="variable" >
    eg:    //html                                   //ts
       <img [src]="url" [alt]="title" />          public class componentName{
                                                   url = "path";title="shinchan";
                                                  }


  c. Event Binding :  It is used to send the data from template to component file as an event. it is represented with parenthesis ()
         <element (event) = "functionName()">
        eg:    //html                                   //ts
       <button (click)="fun()">click</button>     public class componentName{
                                                  fun(){
                                                    alert("hello world")
                                                  }
                                                  }

ii. Two way Data Binding : Angular can even make data transfer between component and template file at a time called two way data binding.To use two way data binding, we can import a module named  "formsModule" whih contains a directive "ngModel"
<element [(ngModel)]="value" >
