Component Communication:
      Component means a small reusable part of user Interface. 
      To generate component, we can use command 
                "ng generate component component-name"
      Every component have 4 files (html - template, css - styling, ts - component file, spec.ts - testing file)
      component file connects all remaining files and generate a name called "selector"
      we can display one component inside another component called "nested components"

sending or receiving data from one component to another component is called component Communication. There are three types of component Communication. They are
    i. parent component to child component
    ii. child component to parent component
    iii. sharing between any two component

i. parent component to child component:
      if one component is inside another component, then outer one is called parent component and inner one is called child component
      For sending data from parent to child we use '@Input'
      parent sends the data as a property
           <app-child   title = "John"></app-child>
      child receives the data in ts using @Input()
            @Input()   title:string ='';
            we need to import @Input
