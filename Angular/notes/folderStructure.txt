step 1 : open vs code --> file --> open folder --> create folders
step 2 : open terminal --> new terminal --> click arrow --> select command prompt
step 3: i created angular folder by clicking folder icon and created three more folders code, notes and projects. so in terminal  , type cd angular --> cd code
step 4 : ng new appname

your application will run in localhost:4200

folder Structure:
Angular install multiple folders and files with new app. Each one means  a separate purpose such as
   i. tsconfig.json   --- it contains rules that are needed for typescript compiler to convert ts into js
     it contains two separate parts such as
     i. tsconfig.app.json: contains rules for app
     ii. tsconfig.spec.json : contains rules for testing
ii. Readme.md ---  it is the instruction file you specify for others to understand or run you code
iii. package.json --- it contains the meta data(data about data) such as name,version, scripts, packages installed etc..,
iv. package-lock.json  -- it contains meta data of package.json

x.  src  --- it contains complete source files
